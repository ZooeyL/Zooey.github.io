Using Kaggle's self-annotated (marked with /s) Reddit comments, I applied logistic regression to test classification accuracy and used the eli5 library to display common sarcastic phrasings. In addition, I used the sentiment library to analyze potential relationship beteween polarity, subjectivity, karma, and sarcasm label of comments.

Time-series analysis of Los Angeles pollutants from year 2000 to 2015, with graphs uploaded on both Tableau and Jupyter. I explain the current state of Los Angeles using AQI measurements and relationship between pollutants.
