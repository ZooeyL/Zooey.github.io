[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ZooeyL/Reddit-Sarcasm-/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%2C%20Text%20Processing%2C%20and%20Visual%20Analysis%20on%20Reddit%20Sarcasm.ipynb)

Using Kaggle's self-annotated (marked with /s) Reddit comments, I applied logistic regression to test classification accuracy and used the eli5 library to display common sarcastic phrasings. In addition, I used the sentiment library to analyze potential relationship beteween polarity, subjectivity, karma, and sarcasm label of comments. 

*Los Angeles Air Pollution*

Time-series analysis of Los Angeles pollutants from year 2000 to 2015, with graphs uploaded on both Tableau and Jupyter. I explain the current state of Los Angeles using AQI measurements and relationship between pollutants. 

*Iowa House Price & Airbnb Price Prediction in Los Angeles

Exploring the data with visualizations and using machine learning (decision trees, linear regression, and K-nearest neighbors) to determine optimal pricing for hosts' accommodations and house price predictions. 

*World Happiness Report* 

[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ZooeyL/World-Happiness-Report/blob/master/Project%207%20-%20Happiness%20Score.ipynb)

I analyze the happiness score assigned by the World Happiness Report, which scores countries based on variables such as economy, family, health, trust, freedom, etc. By looking at correlations between variables and seeing trends within regions, there's quite a lot of useful information embedded in these scores. 

*Kaggle User Survey - Exploratory Analysis* 

[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ZooeyL/Kaggle-User-Survey/blob/master/User%20Survey%20From%20Kaggle%20.ipynb)

Given Kaggle's user information, I try to find useful insight about its demographics.
